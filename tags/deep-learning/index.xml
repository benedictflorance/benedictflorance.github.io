      <description>Recipient of the Mitacs Globalink Research Internship to work on &amp;ldquo;Unsupervised Deep Domain Adaptation for Object Detection&amp;rdquo; under the mentorship of Prof. Eric Granger at Le Laboratoire d’imagerie, de vision et d’intelligence artificielle (LIVIA), ETS Montreal, Canada.
 Working on an unsupervised, still-image to videos domain adaptation by leveraging the temporal coherence of the videos from the target domain with the help of a tracker (ongoing)
 Analyzed the distribution gap and performed studies on local features to show the vulnerabilities of the existing image-to-image adaptation approaches that under-perform on face-detection datasets like SCUT-A, SCUT-B and Widerface but show remarkable results on datasets like Cityscape and SIM10k</description>

      <description>Awarded the prestigious Indian Academy of Sciences’ Summer Research Fellowship (SRFP) to work on &amp;ldquo;Indian Flora Project&amp;rdquo;, a plant species identification and disease detection system under the supervision of Prof. Dr. C. V. Jawahar at Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT), IIIT - Hyderabad.
 Performed transfer learning on various CNN models using our new Indic-Leaf dataset of 112 Indian plants for identification and disease detection with results showing Top-1 and Top-5 precision of 90.</description>

      <description>* Android application was developed for the patients to view their medical health record, add trusted doctors and digitize the medical checkup they undertake with their trusted doctors.
 A web-portal was developed for the registered practitioners to view the health record of their trusted patients, add checkup details, prescribed medicines and other important documents. Wrote APIs for the Android application where the features were deployed.
 The system acts as a collaborative pipeline between doctors and patients and was made foolproof with the help of Aadhaar (National Identity of India) authentication.</description>

      <description>Whether you’re a beginner in machine learning or an expert, you would have had a hard time understanding the concept of backpropagation in neural networks. If you’re a beginner, the first look of the complex steps strung together in the backprop algorithm would’ve been definitely daunting. While a few of us would have spent time in analysing the algorithm and getting the intuition, most of us would have abstracted the learning process.</description>
