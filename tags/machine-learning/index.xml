      <description>The full project report can be found here. Employed Convolutional Neural Network model (ResNet18) by iterating through several different models trained from-the-scratch, fine-tuned on ImageNet, PlantCLEF Encyclopedia of Life, PlantCLEF noisy web datasets on a manually collected, robust dataset of 100 Indian plant species. (using PyTorch) Experimental observations show efficient computation time and high top-5 precision of 99.85% compared to the low performance of state-of-the-art approaches that focus on hand-engineered features.</description>

      <description>A collaborative pipeline between doctors and patients.
 Android application was developed for the patients to view their medical health record, add trusted doctors and digitize the medical checkup they undertake with their trusted doctors.
 A web-portal was developed for the registered practitioners to view the health record of their trusted patients, add checkup details, prescribed medicines and other important scan documents.
 Wrote APIs for the Android application where the features were deployed.</description>

      <title>Breaking down Neural Networks: An intuitive approach to backprop!</title>

      <description>Whether you’re a beginner in machine learning or an expert, you would have had a hard time understanding the concept of backpropagation in neural networks. If you’re a beginner, the first look of the complex steps strung together in the backprop algorithm would’ve been definitely daunting. While a few of us would have spent time in analysing the algorithm and getting the intuition, most of us would have abstracted the learning process.</description>
