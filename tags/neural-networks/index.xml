      <description>The full project report can be found here. Employed Convolutional Neural Network model (ResNet18) by iterating through several different models trained from-the-scratch, fine-tuned on ImageNet, PlantCLEF Encyclopedia of Life, PlantCLEF noisy web datasets on a manually collected, robust dataset of 100 Indian plant species. (using PyTorch) Experimental observations show efficient computation time and high top-5 precision of 99.85% compared to the low performance of state-of-the-art approaches that focus on hand-engineered features.</description>

      <description>Whether you’re a beginner in machine learning or an expert, you would have had a hard time understanding the concept of backpropagation in neural networks. If you’re a beginner, the first look of the complex steps strung together in the backprop algorithm would’ve been definitely daunting. While a few of us would have spent time in analysing the algorithm and getting the intuition, most of us would have abstracted the learning process.</description>
