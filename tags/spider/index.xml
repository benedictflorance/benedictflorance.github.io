      <description>Android application was developed for the patients to view their medical health record, add trusted doctors and digitize the medical checkup they undertake with their trusted doctors.
 A web-portal was developed for the registered practitioners to view the health record of their trusted patients, add checkup details, prescribed medicines and other important documents. Wrote APIs for the Android application where the features were deployed.
 The system acts as a collaborative pipeline between doctors and patients and was made foolproof with the help of Aadhaar (National Identity of India) authentication.</description>
