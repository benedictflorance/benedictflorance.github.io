      <description>Recipient of the Mitacs Globalink Research Internship to work on &amp;ldquo;Unsupervised Deep Domain Adaptation for Object Detection&amp;rdquo; under the mentorship of Prof. Eric Granger at Le Laboratoire d’imagerie, de vision et d’intelligence artificielle (LIVIA), ETS Montreal, Canada.
 Working on an unsupervised, still-image to videos domain adaptation by leveraging the temporal coherence of the videos from the target domain with the help of a tracker (ongoing)
 Analyzed the distribution gap and performed studies on local features to show the vulnerabilities of the existing image-to-image adaptation approaches that under-perform on face-detection datasets like SCUT-A, SCUT-B and Widerface but show remarkable results on datasets like Cityscape and SIM10k</description>
