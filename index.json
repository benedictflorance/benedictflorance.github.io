My areas of interest are at the juncture of deep learning and computer vision. I aim to solve challenging and meaningful real-world problems, like self-driving, through the power of AI.\nI am currently TAing Principles of Deep Learning (ESE 5460) and Applied Machine Learning (CIS 5190) at Penn. Previously, I was a Machine Learning Intern in the Trajectory Prediction team at Cruise developing a critical component that predicts actors around Cruise’s autonomous vehicle (AV), enabling the car to drive safely, comfortably, and human-like. Before my graduate studies, I was a Machine Learning Research Engineer at Infilect, developing visual intelligence to worldwide retail brands and retailers. Back in 2020, I graduated with a B. Tech. (Honors) in CS from NIT Trichy, one of the top ten engineering schools of India. I have been fortunate to work with amazing mentors, Prof. Kostas Daniilidis (GRASP Lab, Penn), Prof. Eric Granger (LIVIA lab, ETS Montreal), Prof. C. V. Jawahar (CVIT lab, IIIT Hyderabad), and Prof. Venkatesh Babu (VAL Lab, IISc Bangalore) on diverse areas of AI including model-based reinforcement learning, domain adaptation, human pose estimation, object detection, segmentation and applications in sports, medicine and biodiversity. I am also a recipient of several prestigious awards like the Vector Scholarship in Artificial Intelligence, Mitacs Globalink Research Internship Award and Indian Academy of Sciences’ Summer Research Fellowship.\n","date":1372636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1372636800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am a grad student in Computer and Information Science (MSE CIS) at the University of Pennsylvania.
